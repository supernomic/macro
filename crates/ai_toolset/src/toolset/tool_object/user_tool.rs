//! A user tool is a tool that's executed by a user instead of an agent loop
//! A user tool transforms a `T: AsyncTool<Context>::call(..) -> R` into `T: AsyncTool<Context>::call(..) -> Defer`
//! A user execues a tool T by posting to /tools/call/{:tool_id} with body appliction/json T
//! User tools are _opaque_ to the tool loop. IE it will call the `call` method like it would
//! for any other tool, but the call method won't trigger execution
